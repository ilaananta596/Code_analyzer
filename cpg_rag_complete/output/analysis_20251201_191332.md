# Code Analysis Report

## What is the overview of this codebase? What are the main components?

**Summary**: This codebase appears to be a simple Java application, likely a command-line interface (CLI) tool, given the presence of a `main` function and a class with an `<init>` method.

**Key Functions**:
- `main`: The entry point of the application.
- `getMessage`: A function that returns a string message.
- `<clinit>`: An empty constructor initializer.
- `<init>`: The constructor for the `App` class.

**How It Works**: The code initializes an instance of the `App` class, which in turn calls the `main` function to start the application. The `getMessage` function is likely used within the `main` function to display a message to the user.

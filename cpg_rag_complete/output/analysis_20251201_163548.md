# Code Analysis Report

## Find entry points and main functions in this codebase

**Summary**: This codebase appears to be a data generation system for direct hit detection, utilizing FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) library. The main functions are responsible for training and generating data.

**Key Functions**:
- `main` (DataGeneration/Retriever/DataGenerationRetriever.py:67): Trains the model multiple times.
- `main` (DataGeneration/DirectHitModule/Direct_Hit_DataGeneration-FAISS.py:97): Trains the model multiple times.
- `default` (DataGeneration/DirectHitModule/Direct_Hit_DataGeneration-FAISS.py:90): Trains the model multiple times.
- `default` (DataGeneration/Retriever/DataGenerationRetriever.py:60): Trains the model multiple times.
- `__init__` (DataGeneration/DirectHitModule/utilities_Faiss.py:15): Initializes the FAISS library.
- `is_direct_hit` (DataGeneration/DirectHitModule/utilities_Faiss.py:21): Checks if a hit is direct.

**How It Works**: The codebase consists of multiple main functions that train the model using the FAISS library. These functions are called repeatedly, suggesting an iterative training process. The `__init__` function initializes the FAISS library, which is used by all other functions to perform similarity searches and detect direct hits.
